:title: Choosing a Scheduler
:description: How to choose a scheduler backend for Deis.


.. _choosing_a_scheduler:

Choosing a Scheduler
====================

The :ref:`scheduler` creates, starts, stops, and destroys each :ref:`container`
of your app. For example, a command such as ``deis scale web=3`` tells the
scheduler to run three containers from the Docker image for your app.

Deis defaults to using the :ref:`fleet_scheduler`. Tech previews of schedulers based on
:ref:`Kubernetes <k8s_scheduler>`, :ref:`Mesos with Marathon <mesos_scheduler>`, and
:ref:`Swarm <swarm_scheduler>` are available for testing.

.. note::

    If you are using a scheduler other than fleet, app containers will not be rescheduled if
    deis-registry is unavailable. For more information, see `deis-registry issue 3619`_.

Settings set by scheduler
-------------------------

The following etcd keys are set by the scheduler module of the controller component.

Some keys will exist only if a particular ``schedulerModule`` backend is enabled.

.. _fleet_scheduler:

Fleet Scheduler
---------------

`fleet`_ is a scheduling backend included with CoreOS:

    fleet ties together systemd and etcd into a distributed init system. Think of
    it as an extension of systemd that operates at the cluster level instead of the
    machine level. This project is very low level and is designed as a foundation
    for higher order orchestration.

``fleetd`` is already running on the machines provisioned for Deis: no additional
configuration is needed. Commands such as ``deis ps:restart web.1`` or
``deis scale cmd=10`` will use `fleet`_ by default to manage app containers.

To use the Fleet Scheduler backend explicitly, set the controller's
``schedulerModule`` to "fleet":

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config controller set schedulerModule=fleet

.. _k8s_scheduler:

Kubernetes Scheduler
--------------------

.. important::

    The Kubernetes Scheduler is a technology preview and is not recommended for production use.
    Since it requires overlay networking, Kubernetes can only be enabled on a new cluster.

`Kubernetes`_ is an orchestration system for Docker containers:

    Kubernetes (k8s) provides APIs to manage, deploy and scale Docker containers. Kubernetes
    deploys containers as `pods`_, providing a unique entity across a cluster, but allowing
    containers within the pod to share a namespace.

Kubernetes requires the `flannel`_ overlay network so each pod receives a unique IP address within
the cluster. Existing Deis clusters cannot simply turn on overlay networking. Instead, provision
a new cluster to enable `flannel`_.

To test the Kubernetes Scheduler, first install and start the Kubernetes components:

.. code-block:: console

    $deisctl install k8s && deisctl start k8s

Then set the controller's ``schedulerModule`` to "k8s":

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config controller set schedulerModule=k8s

The Kubernetes scheduler is now active. Commands such as ``deis destroy`` or ``deis scale web=9``
will use the Kubernetes ApiServer to manage app pods.

Deis creates a `replication controller`_ to manage pods and a `service`_ which proxies traffic to
the pods for your app. Unlike other Deis schedulers, new app releases on Kubernetes do a rolling
deploy: pods with the new release replace old pods one at a time, until all are replaced (or until
an error forces a rollback to the previous release).

.. note::

    **Known Issues**

    - The flannel overlay network is not backward-compatible with earlier Deis clusters, since it
      changes Docker networking and requires new units from Deis' user-data file.
    - The Kubernetes ApiServer is not HA. If the ApiServer is rescheduled, it will reschedule all
      Kubernetes units.
    - Kubernetes implements resource-based scheduling. Specifying limits will create a reservation
      of that resource on the node.
    - When changing schedulers from k8s to another, the etcd keys in ``/registry/services/specs``
      will have to be removed before apps can be routed.

.. _mesos_scheduler:

Mesos with Marathon framework
-----------------------------

.. important::

    The Mesos with Marathon framework Scheduler is a technology preview and is not recommended for
    production use.

`Mesos`_ is a distributed system kernel:

    Mesos provides APIs for resource management and scheduling. A framework interacts with Mesos master
    and schedules and task. A Zookeeper cluster elects Mesos master node. Mesos slaves are installed on
    each node and they communicate to master with available resources.

`Marathon`_ is a Mesos_ framework for long running applications:

    Marathon provides a Paas like feel for long running applications and features like high-availablilty, host constraints,
    service discovery, load balancing and REST API to control your Apps.

Deis uses the Marathon framework to schedule containers. Since Marathon is a framework for long-running
jobs, Deis uses the :ref:`fleet_scheduler` to run batch processing jobs. ``deisctl`` installs a standalone Mesos
cluster. To install an HA Mesos cluster, follow the directions at `aledbf-mesos`_, and set the etcd key
``/deis/scheduler/mesos/marathon`` to any Marathon node IP address. If a request is received by a regular
Marathon node, it is proxied to the master Marathon node.

To test the Marathon Scheduler backend, first install and start the mesos components:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl install mesos && deisctl start mesos

Then set the controller's ``schedulerModule`` to "mesos_marathon":

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config controller set schedulerModule=mesos_marathon

The Marathon framework is now active. Commands such as ``deis destroy`` or
``deis scale web=9`` will use `Marathon`_ to manage app containers.

Deis starts Marathon on port 8180. You can manage apps through the Marathon UI, which is accessible at http://<Marathon-node-IP>:8180

.. note::

    **Known Issues**

    - deisctl installs a standalone mesos cluster as fleet doesn't support runtime change to metadata.
      You can specify this in cloud-init during the deployment of the node. keep watching `dynamic metadata fleet PR 1077`_.
    - If you want to access Marathon UI, you'll have to expose port 8180 in the security group settings.
      This is blocked off by default for security purposes.
    - Deis does not yet use Marathon's docker container API to create containers.
    - CPU shares are integers representing the number of CPUs. Memory limits should be specified in MB.

.. _swarm_scheduler:

Swarm Scheduler
---------------

.. important::

    The Swarm Scheduler is a technology preview and is not recommended for
    production use.

`swarm`_ is a scheduling backend for Docker:

    Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts
    into a single, virtual host.

..

    Swarm serves the standard Docker API, so any tool which already communicates
    with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts...

Deis includes an enhanced version of swarm v0.2.0 with node failover and optimized
locking on container creation. The Swarm Scheduler uses a `soft affinity`_ filter
to spread app containers out among available machines.

Swarm requires the Docker Remote API to be available at TCP port 2375. If you are
upgrading an earlier installation of Deis, please refer to the CoreOS documentation
to `enable the remote API`_.

.. note::

    **Known Issues**

    - It is not yet possible to change the default affinity filter.

To test the Swarm Scheduler backend, first install and start the swarm components:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl install swarm && deisctl start swarm

Then set the controller's ``schedulerModule`` to "swarm":

.. code-block:: console

    $ deisctl config controller set schedulerModule=swarm

The Swarm Scheduler is now active. Commands such as ``deis destroy`` or
``deis scale web=9`` will use `swarm`_ to manage app containers.

To monitor Swarm Scheduler operations, watch the logs of the swarm-manager
component, or spy on Docker events directly on the swarm-manager machine:
